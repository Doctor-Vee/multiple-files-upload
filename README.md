# Multiple Files Upload Service

This is a simple service that helps you upload multipart files in batches to a folder in your application.

Run the project ... It should start on port 7750

You can access the Swagger documentation through this link
http://localhost:7750/swagger-ui.html

For the POST requests to /uploads, kindly use Postman... Swagger is throwing errors for some reason which I've not been able to figure out
